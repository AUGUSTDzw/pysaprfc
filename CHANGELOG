04.04.2004 - Release 1.0.0
10.03-20.03.2004 - Some changes and fixes preparing for the stable release 1.0.0.
             RFC_FUNC: 
               imports(), exports() and tables() methods, returning names of parameters.
               Better descriptions (desc nad desc_obj attributes).
               func_args and func_res properties which enable more 'pythonic' way to call RFCs.
               It's now possible to set structured parameters from dictionaries (key=field,value=field value),
               and tables from a list of dictionaries, strings, lists, or tables.
             Rfc_connection:
               read_table now works with WAS 6.x and hopefully 4.7 systems.
               New helper method search_functions() returns the list of RFC enabled functions in the remote system.
               New helper method make_py_func() returns a function wrapper around RFC_FUNC.
             
24.09.2003 - Release 0.99.0 (first beta)
24.09.2003 - Added pyabap.py and exmaple6.py demonstrating its usage.
13.09.2003 - Fixed a long-standing bug in Rfc_connection.get_interface.
             Added example3a.py which demonstrates usage of conversion routines.
11.09.2003 - The set_conversion method now also accepts a list of field names as the first argument. Unit tests for
             conversion routines.
10.09.2003 - Conversion routines via convert_input and convert_output attributes. Currently supported
             types are 'C', 'N', 'D', 'T', and 'P'. Use the set_conversion classmethod of STRUCT class to
             add conversion routines to fields of a structure (Single character fields are not (yet) supported.)
             Some fixes for DATE datatype (handling of initial values).
08.09.2003 - Added support for SAP INT1 and INT2 datatypes and append_from_string method to the ItTable
07.09.2003 - Added the exec_abap and exec_abap_file to the Rfc_connection object allowing execution of arbitrary
             ABAP code on the target client without the need of installing it.
             Some changes to the initialization of SAP datatypes. (Passing None now sets datatype to its initial value.)
27.08.2003 - First attempt at STRING datatype. Untested.
26.08.2003 - Fixed a bug in create_struct.
11.07.2003 - Release 0.2.2
07.07.2003 - Undone the "length of BCD fields" fix. The size should be in bytes, not in digits.
             When calling RFC_SERV_FUNC the init_data method should be called before get_data. Fixed.
06.07.2003 - Added the connection attribute to the RFC_SERV_FUNC to enable performing RFCs from RFC server.
             Fixed the length of BCD fields (type P) returned from get_fieldlist, get_fielddict and get_structure
             methods of Rfc_connection. Reported length was in bytes, we need digits.
05.07.2003 - Alternative implementation of RFC server (RfcServEx). This version uses RfcGetName(Ex) instead
             of RfcDispatch and as such doesn't need the C callback function. Seems more stable as RfcServ.
             Fix for to_string and from_string methods of class STRUCT.
27.06.2003 - Bugfixes for Storage object. One can now even use stored function interface definitions for 
             RFC_SERV_FUNC objects (_interface_from_) :-)
26.06.2003 - Release 0.2.1
23.06.2003 - Support for RFC enabled SAP R/3 systems prior to version 4.0
14.06.2003 - Release 0.2.0
09.06.2003 - Some adjustment to the Storage objects and sap_get_defs.py
06.06.2003 - Implemented the Storage object (a wrapper around shelve) to store data definitions and function
             interfaces. Added a simple script sap_get_defs.py in the tools directory to facilitate its usage.
05.06.2003 - Some adjustments to the server interface.
02.06.2003 - Finished basic server implementation. The interface might change in future.
28.05.2003 - Fixed stupid mistake - ItTable should be new-style class as it uses properties.
             Added optional argument 'handle' to the ItTable __init__ method to allow external handles (i.e.
             tables passed from SAP system) to be used. This is for upcoming server-side ability.
24.05.2003 - Treat integers and all-digit strings as datatype N when assigning to string (datatype C) - experimental 
19.05.2003 - Structures: added support for equality checking (__eq__ and __ne__ methods), implemented is_equal method,
             added methods to convert structure to/from string.
             Improved table field event handling (event handler constructor now accepts field lists to chain fields).
16.05.2003 - First public release
15.05.2003 - Added basic unit tests
14.05.2003 - Initial release (to CVS)
